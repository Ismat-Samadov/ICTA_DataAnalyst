# Task Instructions

Dear Candidate,

After completing the tasks, please send us the Power BI file. If you create the report with Tableau, upload the report to your Tableau Public profile and share the link with us. If you are proficient in both, please prioritize Power BI.

This Excel file contains two tasks. The second task is a small DAX-related task. Please refer to the "Task 2" page for the details of the second task.

## Task 1: Employee Attendance Performance Dashboard

You are requested to create a dashboard to evaluate the attendance performance of employees.

It is up to you to decide which KPIs to calculate, how many pages to include in the report, how to group the reports, and how to structure drilldowns.

In the first table, the entry and exit times of employees are provided. If an employee is on leave, their data will not be recorded for that day since they did not pass through the turnstile.

While creating the reports and calculating KPIs, please consider the following:

- Table 2, which contains the daily permission hours
- Table 3, which contains the leave days

### Continuation of Task 1: Monthly Fines and Bonuses Report

At the end, create a report that shows the monthly fines and bonuses. This report should allow us to see how much bonus or fine should be applied to each employee in each department every month.

Fines and bonuses are calculated as follows:

- Delay of up to 3 hours: no fine
- Delay of 3-10 hours: 2% salary deduction
- Delay of 10-20 hours: 3% salary deduction
- Delay of more than 20 hours: 5% salary deduction

- Overtime of up to 3 hours: no bonus
- Overtime of 3-10 hours: 2% salary bonus
- Overtime of 10-20 hours: 3% salary bonus
- Overtime of more than 20 hours: 5% salary bonus
